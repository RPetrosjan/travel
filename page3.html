                4 Methods For Creating Equal Height Columns In CSS



                One of the few things that isn’t as simple to do with css as it should be is creating columns of equal heights. A variety of methods do exist, each with its pros and cons and I want to present 4 methods here.

                Let’s think for a moment about what we mean by equal height columns.

                We generally don’t mean that we want the content inside each column to be of equal height. If that were the case there really isn’t a problem as the height of the columns will naturally be the same height.

                What we really mean by equal height columns is having the columns look as though they’re of equal height when the content inside isn’t.

                We can achieve that by making the css backgrounds behind the column appear to be of equal height. Ultimately we’re faking equal heights.

                For those of you wanting to get directly to the demos and code you can click any of the images above the sections below and be taken to the appropriate demo.

                Equal height columns with faux Columns

                Faux Columns
                Faux columns have been around a long time. 2004 to be exact. For that same long time they were and maybe still are the deFacto method for creating columns of equal height.

                It’s a simple trick using a background image that’s repeated vertically. An example of this repeating image is seen below. I’ve increase the height so you can see it.

                Faux columns background

                The image is usually created as a single px in height and it’s width will match the width of your layout. Where one column becomes another in the layout, the faux column image will change as well.

                The html
                For this example we’ll use html that’s similar to what we’ve been working with the last few weeks, though I’ll skip the header and footer to focus on the columns.

                    <div id="sidebar">
            <p>Sidebar</p>
        </div>

        <div id="content">
            <p>Main content</p>
        </div>

    </div>
    You could use the body as the container, but I’m choosing to use a container div so you can see that this technique can work for setting up columns inside a part of your overall layout in addition to the overall layout itself.

    The css

    #container {
    width:960px;
    margin:0 auto;
    background: url("faux-columns.png") repeat-y;
    overflow: hidden
    }

    #sidebar {
    float:left;
    width:340px;
    }

    #content {
    float:left;
    width:620px;
    }
    The css here is pretty simple. Floating and setting widths on #sidebar and #content should be familiar to you by now as well as setting the width and margin on #container.

    What’s new here is setting the faux-column background image on the container and using overflow: hidden on the container.

    We need to set the overflow property to ensure the container div doesn’t collapse. Because everything inside is floated we need to force it back open.

    The container will then always be the same height as the longer of the 2 columns and the background image will make it appear as though the shorter column is also the same height.

    This method works best for fixed width layouts though it can work with more fluid layouts as well.

    You also aren’t limited to a simple color change in backgrounds. Borders, shadows, patterns, etc. can be added by adding them in the appropriate place on the faux-column image.

    For patterns you might choose to create an image more than 1px in height.

    Pros:

    Easy to set up
    Work regardless of which column is the longer or shorter
    Cons:

    Requires an image, which requires an additional http request
    Any change to the layout requires the image be reworked
    Need to know what your layout will look like in advance to create the image
    Pseudo method for creating equal height columns

    Pseudo Columns
    I’ve never cared for faux columns. Not because it’s a bad method, but because I have a thing about never using an image for a solid background color.

    Because of that I developed my own method for achieving equal height columns, which for lack of a better term I’ll call pseudo columns.

    It works similarly to faux columns as it involves setting a background on the container. It’s not a general approach to equal height columns and has a very limited use case, but when you encounter that use case it works well and easily.

    The html
    We’ll use the same html as the faux column method above.

        </div>

        <div id="content">
            <p>Main content</p>
        </div>

    </div>
    Once again no header and footer so we can focus on the columns.

    The css
    The css is again quite simple. I’ve gone with a fluid layout here for variety, but you could just as easily set this up to be fixed width.

    #container {
    background: #555;
    overflow: hidden
    }

    #content {
    float:left;
    width:75%;
    background:#eee;
    }

    #sidebar {
    float:left;
    width:25%;
    background:#555;
    }
    Other than using % instead of px, you’ll notice that here I’ve set the background colors on #content and #sidebar. You’ll only need to set it on whichever column will be longer, but here I’ve set it on both.

    The main change from faux columns is instead of a background image we set a background color. It’s the same principle in that we’re allowing the background of the container to show through beneath the shorter columns.

    The limitation is we need to know which column will be shorter in advance and ideally that same column would be shorter on every page of the site.

    That sounds like a pretty big limitation, but I find in practice one of the two columns is usually shorter across most, if not all, pages and for those pages where it might not be the case, it’s easy enough to add a little more or less content to make it so.

    Pros:

    Easy to set up
    Easy to maintain
    Cons:

    Harder to implement on more than 2 or 3 columns
    Requires you know the relative heights of columns in advance
    Doesn’t work as well when different columns are longer or shorter on different pages
    This method is far from perfect, but you might be surprised how often it can be applied in practice.

    Equal height columns with borders and negative margins

    Borders and Negative Margins
    This is a method I came across not too long ago on a Smashing Magazine article by Thierry Koblentz, though I later found an article by Alan Pearce on A List Apart written a few years ago detailing the same method.

    It uses borders and negative margins to give the appearance of the equal height columns.

    The html
    Nothing new in the html here compared to what we’ve seen above. In his article Thierry uses the body as the container, but I’ll stick to using a container div as is my usual practice.

        </div>

        <div id="content">
            <p>Main content</p>
        </div>

    </div>
    The css
    The css is where things get interesting. The container is just being used to fix the width and center the layout. The interesting stuff happens on #content and #sidebar.

    #container {
    width:960px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    }

    #content {
    float:left;
    width:700px;
    border-left: 260px solid #555;
    }

    #sidebar {
    float: left;
    width:260px;
    margin-right: -260px;
    position: relative;
    }
    All the background colors in this method are set on the #content column. We set it’s background as normal and then give it a left border equal to the width of the sidebar. We also set the border color to what we want the sidebar background to be.

    If we stop here you’ll see both columns displayed where you want, however our border-left has pushed the actual sidebar off the page and we need to bring it back.

    First we give the sidebar a negative right margin equal to its width (or the width of the left border of the content, which are the same). That will bring the sidebar back to where we want, but it still isn’t visible.

    The problem is in the stacking order of the 2 divs. #container is sitting on top of #sidebar so we need to move #sidebar to the front. We do that by adding position: relative to the sidebar and now it’s content is visible.

    Pros:

    Works regardless of which columns is longer or shorter
    Easy to set up once you understand how it works
    Easy to maintain
    Cons:

    Sidebar width needs to be fixed as border-width only accepts absolute measurements
    Negative margins can potentially trip up some older versions of IE
    I’d encourage you to read both articles I linked to above as they offer more details than I am here. Both contain code for using this method with a third column and Thierry’s article talks about setting up borders between the columns.

    Equal height columns with offset containers

    Offset Columns and Containers
    This last method is one created by Matthew James Taylor. Of all the methods presented here this one will work under the most use cases.

    I’ve saved it for the end since it’s a little more complex and you might need to read through it a few times to understand how it works.

    The html
    The html is similar to what we’ve seen above though you’ll note an extra container div to what we’ve seen before.

    12
    13

    As with the other methods we’ll use these containers to set background colors that will appear as though they belong to our columns.

    The css
    There’s a lot more going on here than what we’ve seen to this point. Both #sidebar and #content are floated left and given a width, but beyond that just about everything else is new.

    The key to this method is the idea that a floated container will always be the same height as its floated content. By floating all of our columns inside all of the floated containers we ensure our container divs will always be equal in height to the tallest column.

    #container-outer {
    float:left;
    overflow: hidden;
    background: #eee;
    }

    #container-inner {

    background: #555;

    right:75%;
    }

    #sidebar {
    float: left;
    width: 25%;
    position: relative;
    left: 75%;
    }

    #content {
    float: left;
    width: 75%;
    position: relative;
    left: 75%
    }
    The first step here is to float both the columns and the containers. I have everything floated to the left, but the direction isn’t important. Use whatever direction you need for your layout.

    The next step is setting backgrounds on the 2 container divs. Here I’ve set the background on the inner container to be the one we want on the sidebar and the outer container background to what we want on the main content.

    If we stop here we’ll only see the background on the inner div since it’s higher in the stacking order than the outer div.

    We need to a little css positioning to shift the inner div so it shows only where we want the sidebar to display. That will allow the background on the outer div to show through behind where we want the content column to display.

    1
    2
    3
    4
    #container-inner {
    position: relative;
    right: 75%;
    }
    We position the inner column and then set it’s right value to be 75% which is the same as the width of our content column.

    Our backgrounds are now in place, however the content of both columns has also shifted 75% to the left. We need to shift it back into place.

    #sidebar {
    position: relative;
    left:75%
    }

    #content {
    position: relative;
    left:75%
    }
    Once again we use relative positioning and because the content in both columns has been shifted 75% to the left we need to shift it back 75% to the right. We do that by setting the left value to 75%.

    Now everything is back where it should be.

    Pros:

    Works regardless of which column is longer or shorter
    Works with any kind of layout (fixed, fluid, elastic, etc)
    Can handle as many columns as you want
    Cons:

    A little more difficult to understand at first
    Requires additional and non-semantic container divs
    Overall this is the most foolproof method and the one guaranteed to work for any use case. I’d encourage you to play around with this one to really understand it and read through Matthew’s article a few times.

    Matthew’s article walks through a 3 column layout and he has demos for both 4 and 5 columns as well. I chose to present a 2 column layout in the hopes it would make the concepts easier to understand.

    Additional Resources
    By no means are these the only methods for creating equal height columns. Chris Coyier shared a several other methods on CSS Tricks a few months back that you may prefer over those presented here.

    Fluid Width Equal Height Columns
    There are also plenty of other methods you can find with a little searching. Between this article and Chris’ I think most of the more common methods are covered.

    Two standing columns at the ruins of a Roman theatre in Arles

    Summary
    Equal height columns are a desirable design trait, but they haven’t always been easy to create with css layouts. Ideally we’d be able to use something like height: 100% and be done with it, but for now we can use any of the methods mentioned above.

    Faux columns are easy to set up, but they require an extra http request for the image and any change to the layout requires a new image.

    Pseudo columns are even easier, but have a limited use case where the relative heights of both columns are known and consistent across pages.

    Borders and negative margins are relatively easy to work with, require no foreknowledge of column heights and better adapt to multiple columns. They require one column be fixed width.

    Offset columns and containers work across the most cases. They require no foreknowledge of column heights and can work with as many columns as you want. The method is a little more complex than the other methods.

    In time I expect a much simpler standard css solution, but until then these 4 methods should suffice for your project.

    Do you design equal height css column layouts often? What method for creating the columns to use when you do?

    Download a free sample from my book, Design Fundamentals.

    You can recreate your image with css3

    background-image: -webkit-gradient(
    linear,
    left bottom,
    right bottom,
    color-stop(0.25, rgb(255,21,0)),
    color-stop(0.25, rgb(0,255,255))
    );

    But since some of your solutions had a con like “Not IE() compatible” I can understand that this is not an option

    Thanks Emil,

    Yep. The lack of IE support makes it hard to recommend css gradients as a standard option. You can certainly use them of course as long as you’re aware of the limitation and provide for a fall back in IE.

    And again these are by no means the only methods for creating columns of equal height. Just 4 I think work well.

    In the Pseudo and Offset methods, the sidebar is clipped when the browser width is reduced.

    Thanks David. I do see that. It’s because I set both of those methods up as flexible layouts and then filled the columns with non-flexible content. The code is wrapped in pre tags, which doesn’t let what’s inside flow.

    My bad with the demo, but the methods still work as they should.

    I use jQuery. No javascript? Fine, things will still work.

    jQuery(function($) {

    var sh = $(“#sidebar”).height();
    var ch = $(“#content”).height();
    var diff = sh – ch;

    if(diff > 0) {
    // sidebar is taller
    $(“#content”).height(sh);
    else {
    // content is taller or heights are equal
    $(“#sidebar”).height(ch);
    }

    });

    Thanks David. JavaScript is another method used for equal height columns. I’m of the opinion that JavaScript is generally not the best solution for layout though I do know people use it.

    As long as the layout still works without JavaScript I guess there’s no problem, but I prefer to stick with html and css for layout.

    You can also use a padding/margin “hack”

    I setup an example here

    Interesting Greg. I take it the negative bottom margin on the floated columns combined with the overflow hidden on the container is what makes the column equal height.

    I’ve never seen that before. Do you have a post explaining how it all works?

    Basicly he makes the columns really tall (padding) and crops it with a wrapper (overflow:hidden), then pull any content after it back (minus margin).
    Has to be aware that content after it cannot be inside the wrapper. So for example a footer should be outside the wrapper, otherwise its background would be stacked below the floated elements. This means doubled container in many cased.
    Here is another example with this technique.

    Just a little bit modern way:

    #container {
    display: table;
    }
    #content {
    display: table-cell;
    vertical-align: top;
    }
    #sidebar {
    display: table-cell;
    vertical-align: top;
    }

    Thanks Rado. I haven’t played enough with css tables to know how well they work. I think browser support for them is pretty good though so I imagine this is another solution to the problem.

    I loved this method, but then I found out that for fluid layout it doesn’t work in Firefox, because the max-width on images is not respected, they drop out of their container. I tried to figure out until i reached the point of a FF bug. Try if you can set it and let us know if anyone gets this version to work perfect. I’d love to use it until flexbox arrived fully.

    That’s strange. I wouldn’t think Firefox would have an issue with max-width.

    I think it’s safe to use flexbox now. The latest versions of I think all browsers support it. You can just about support most everything in use if you’re willing to use older versions of the syntax and vendor prefixes too.

    vertical-align: top;

    This is crucial in table cell. Without it, IE takes shorter div to the bottom of table. You saved my day,Thank you !!!

    Awesome tutorial; thanks for sharing! 🙂 I’ve always used the “Faux Column” work-around for equal column heights, but it’s great to see other methods in action!

    I remember when I first started with CSS, I ran into this issue of “un-equal” divs and didn’t know what to do.

    Thanks,
    Rob

    Thanks Rob. Faux Columns is a good method, probably the most popular. I generally don’t use it, but it’s more my personal thing about not using an image for a solid blog of color. I’m always looking for way to translate an image into code.

    I came up with my pseudo method when I had to deal with unequal columns. I know it only works for limited cases, but I think those limited cases come up a lot.

    Of course if we use the same background colors behind all columns the issue goes away. Maybe that’s the easiest method.

    OK, these are all interesting. But what about equal columns, sidebar and content with the same background color and borders turned on? The negative padding-bottom/margin-bottom trick won’t work since hiding overflow-y also has the consequence of hiding the title that is been negatively margined above the div for style purposes.

    So how do people get equal height divs when we are doing borders not backgrounds?

    Steven Bradley says:

    These methods wouldn’t work for that.

    My first thought is to ask if you really need everything to have borders. Probably not. The point of borders is to enclose and separate areas on the page. Different colored backgrounds do the same. So does space. You could present the information itself differently to separate it as well.

    There are lots of different ways to solve the same problem.

    // setting layout columns same height
    $(document).ready(function(){
    if($(‘#content’).height() > $(‘#sidebar’).height())	{
    $(‘#sidebar’).height($(‘#content’).height());

    $(‘#content’).height($(‘#sidebar’).height());

    For those case (like update content via AJAX), its more dynamic way.

    Matthew James Taylor’s solution is absolutely brilliant and I’ve been using it exclusively for over a year. One reason it seems so complicated is the way he addresses the IE box model error (by creating faux padding).

    In your exposition of his method, you simplified. It makes the method easier to grasp but it may lead readers down a bad path. If padding is applied to the containers, formatting problems may ensue. If MJT’s faux padding is used to avoid the problems, the column width math gets very tedious.

    To deal with this, I use MJT’s method just as you as show it but ONLY for the structure of the columns (and their backgrounds). To handle content, I create interior containers in each column. Those containers can be formatted as desired, including margins or padding to provide separation. The result is simpler math, simpler changes if the widths need to change, easier formatting of column content, and the ability to deal with box model issues if they come up.

    Thanks for the excellent summary. It’s an excellent presentation.

    Thanks for the extra info about the faux padding. I hadn’t realized my simplification could lead to problems, though now that you mention it I did have some issues using this method on a site not too long ago and the padding was most likely the culprit. I forget how I solved things. I’ll have to check and also double check Matthew’s post.

    So are you then creating a 3rd level container for the content?

    These solutions probably wouldn’t work in that case, but why should they? They’re a solution to a different problem.

    In your case I’d guess you need to use something like Javascript to determine if there’s content in the sidebar and based on what’s returned offer different layouts. However before doing that I’d ask myself if there could be times when a sidebar will have no content is a sidebar really the best design solution. Would it be better to present the content in some other location?

    Hi Steven,
    you need to abstract from the ‘content/sidebar’ example you have used as a example here – the essential part is how to “Creating Equal Height Columns In CSS”. In this perspective, an empty div will normally hide if it is empty – a feature that is unavailable with any of these equal-height solutions. I actually make use of this empty-div feature and need two columns to be equal height

    Again these 4 methods aren’t meant to be the solution to every problem. Could you send me a link to a page where you have the empty column? If I can see your code maybe I can help.

    I’m curious though why you don’t think any of these solutions could work. None really require that there be any content in the sidebar.

    Hey there. I’m a big fan of what you call Pseudo columns too… You don’t actually need to know which column is longer, since the main container has an overflow of hidden, adding a massive amount of padding to the bottom of each inner div and then an equivalent negative margin gets the background colours to stretch to fill the height.

    There is of course an extreme edge case where the difference of the height of the columns exceeds the arbitrary values you choose for the margin/padding but for most real world uses it’s definitely the way to go as it’s the lightest weight option.

    #container {
    background: #555; /* NOT actually needed */
    overflow: hidden
    }

    .lt-ie8 #container {display:inline-block;} /* Takes advantage of the improper implementation of inline block in ie7 and lower */

    #content, #sidebar {
    padding-bottom:32111px;
    margin-bottom:-32111px;
    }
    #content {
    float:left;
    width:75%;
    background:#eee;
    }
    #sidebar {
    float:left;
    width:25%;
    background:#555;
    }

    Thanks Darcy. I’m with you. I know pseudo columns aren’t a perfect solution, but in real world cases they often work well. I hadn’t realized about not needing to know in advance the longer column, but not that I think about it, I have done similar with the padding and negative margin.

    I appreciate the addition to the method.

    This is an excellent article, and I used the suggestions here to start converting the websites I have built to use CSS instead of traditional tables.

    I have a general dislike of websites where the height of a particular column is much greater than the height of the others – I think it shows poor foresight because of the ’empty spaces’ it leaves in the other columns.

    To avoid this I actually set the height of each column to the same value, i.e. a ‘sensible’ value depending on the use for the ‘panel’. I then set overflow to auto, which will automatically add a scroll bar to the right if the content is greater than the height set.

    I just wondered what you thought of this as an idea?

    Regards Peter

    Steven Bradley says:

    Thanks Peter. I’m not sure if different column heights is necessarily poorly planned. It depends on the overall design. Right now here this column is much larger than the column on the left as far as the content inside, but it was done on purpose. I wanted the empty space to allow room for the column with the main text. Space can be a good thing.

    If the backgrounds are off I do agree. That’s often poor planning.

    Setting overflow and allowing for a scrollbar can work. I’ve seen sites pull it off well. I’m generally not a big fan of having extra scrollbars though. I think they can sometimes be confusing or make it difficult to scroll the part of the page you want to scroll. It really depends how it’s done though. I have seen it work well.

    Hi Steven,

    I tried your last solution, which works great… However, if you add padding the layout breaks. Plus I have a thing against non-semantic HTML.

    I -think- I found a simple solution that will allow padding, doesn’t require any extra non-semantic html (e.g. – an “inner” container div). I’ve tested it in all browsers (even IE8) and it seems to work perfectly. Let me know what you think? :

    #container {
    overflow: hidden;
    position: relative;
    }

    #sidebar {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 25%;
    -moz-box-sizing:border-box;
    -webkit-box-sizing:border-box;
    box-sizing:border-box;
    background: #ccc; /* Aesthetic, not required */
    padding: 10px; /* Aesthetic, not required */
    }

    #content {
    float: right;
    width: 75%;
    -moz-box-sizing:border-box;
    -webkit-box-sizing:border-box;
    box-sizing:border-box;
    background: #eee; /* Aesthetic, not required */
    padding: 10px; /* Aesthetic, not required */

    Nevermind, it’s not a perfect solution. It won’t work if the content of #sidebar is longer than the content of #content.

    So I guess your last solution is probably the best one 🙂 However IMO I would add box-sizing: border-box to the child divs, this way padding can be added without breaking the layout.

    It would be nice if this was easier in css and it will be once we’re using flexbox regularly. I don’t think it’s equivalent to driving a nail with a boulder, though.

    CSS doesn’t have the capability to do everything with a single line of code. I think this is just one of those things we assume should be easy to implement in css, but isn’t as easy as we think.

    If you don’t mind a poylfill for older versions of IE and you don’t need to support Opera Mini, you can use flexbox now, which does make equal height columns a simple thing.

    True. Older versions of IE are often what holds us up. I think flexbox can be made to work though. If you don’t mind using older versions of the syntax, you can use Flexie.js as a polyfill for IE6-9.

    You’d still have to use vendor prefixes too, but that only leaves Opera Mini as the browser flexbox won’t work in. That’s not a lot to wait on.

    With IE in general, once people are past IE9 things should get better. If I’m not mistaken starting with IE10 IE will autoupdate. I could be mistaken about the autoupdate, though.

    I think flexbox is very close to being production ready. Some sites already use it. Once it’s used in production, I expect it’ll become the dominant method for building websites.

    Surprisingly or not, today, we(the rest of the world) and IE-centric developers, we all want (and hope in) the same set of standards.

    The fact that IE devs start to accept / adopt other devel groups initiatives and standards is good, they finally discovered they are not alone on the planet – and the fact that this(web-development) game is at global scale.
    Flexbox will be the painless method of any-to-any-layout for a long period of time (I hope ;)).

    Until then, media queries – table-cells and where nothing is working,… jQuery for dynamic re-layouting.

    I’m glad most browsers are upgrading quicker than they used to. It’s nice knowing pretty much everyone who uses a browser is on the latest version. We’re not quite there yet with all of them, but some are on board.

    I’m ready for flexbox. I probably will use it the next time I redesign this site. Like you said, until then we’ll just continue as usual.

    Microsoft too switches to silent updates with IE, which can be a good step forward. IE less then 9 should be dead after that, and IE9 too soon. IE10 unfortunately most likely will stick around for a long time.

    Is IE10 really that bad? I think IE has gotten a lot better as far as rendering standard compliant code over the last few versions. There will always be some things we want to do that we can’t yet, but once all browsers are auto updating things will definitely be better.

    You can definitely use flexbox now, though I don’t think that means you shouldn’t consider older versions of IE. It depends a lot on the specific site. Will the audience for this site use older versions of IE?

    I’m not sure I’d use flexbox for the entire layout of a site, though I think you could. People are using flexbox now on live sites. It’s more likely used for the layout of components (navigation, forms) than for the entire site/page layout, though I think you could use it for the latter.

    I have a book coming relatively soon about flexbox. It probably won’t help for a site you’re about to design now, but perhaps the site after that.

    They are hacks and better solutions are coming. Flexbox, for example, makes equal height columns simple. There are still a few browser versions in use that don’t support flexbox, but not many. CSS Grids have less support, but they also provide equal height columns easily. Until they’re used more frequently though, we still have the methods I described in this post.
